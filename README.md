A fully featured Command Block IDE
</p>

<br>

Commander IDE is an **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment to Code CommandBlock programms.

<br>

**Note:** This is still in development. It doesn't do much yet.

For now there is **no** deployment version. <br>
If you still want to build and execute the programm, follow these steps:

0. Open up your terminal (and navigate somewhere you want to download the repository to) <br><br>
1. Make sure you have nodejs installed. Test by  entering <br>
$ `node -v` <br>
If this returns a version number, NodeJS is installed. **If not**, get NodeJS <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">here</a>. <br><br>
2. Make sure electron is installed <br>
$ `electron -v` <br>
If this returns a version number, Electron is installed. **If not**, get it by typing <br>
$ `sudo npm install -g electron` <br><br>
3. Clone the repository and navigate to it. You can either download it <a href="https://github.com/EpticMC/Commander-IDE/archive/master.zip">here</a> or if you have Git installed, type <br>
$ `git clone https://github.com/EpticMC/Commander-IDE.git && cd Commander-IDE` <br><br>
4. Install all dependencies <br>
$ `npm install` <br><br>
5. Wait for it to finish. After installation is done, run the programm with <br>
$ `npm start`
